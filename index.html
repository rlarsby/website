            introduced them to the university in general. The second group was a group of 38 first year students of whom I had similar
            responsibilites but also served as a social mentor.</p>

                other material in the product. The result was a luxurious teacup where the handle was made out of wood instead of porcelain. Beyond contributing
                to the concept I designed the teacup in CAD.</p>
